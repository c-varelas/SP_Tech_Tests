#Data warehouse  
A data warehouse is a type of data management system designed to analyze, organize, and report information directed towards business. This help business to keep track and gain insight to improve any decision-making. 

## Cloud computing  
- Cloud computing is similar to a hard drive in which we store and access data in a little device. Cloud computing is similar instead of having a physical object we are able to store and access data and programs via the internet. 

## AWS  
- AWS acronym for Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing technology that users pay for that provides a mixture of services(data storage options, computing power, networking…. etc) making it flexible for any users to stay organized and be in control. 

## Google Analytics  
- Google Analytics is a free technology used primarily for website owners to retrieve a report of guests that visits the website daily. This helps the owner keep track of time spent on a page/site, where the guests come from, and how they navigate through the site. 

## Cookies  
- Cookies are similar to a username and passwords. Cookies are text files created when browsing through a website. Cookies make it easier for an individual to browse through sites by saving information. This includes being automatically logged in, sites preferences, and locally relevant content. 

## Imagine your daily routine includes repetitive and manual tasks, how would you  automate these? Which tools would you use? Do you have any examples of such  tasks and real experience automating them? Tell us about that.  

- I would seek a tool that is used to improve automate repetitive tasks to save time for long and difficult tasks that need to be completed. A tool I would use is Slack. Slack provides a fast and easy automated tool known as ‘Workflow Builder’ that reduces time efficiency. This includes requests processes, shared updates, feedback, etc…. During the final stage of Coding  Bootcamp, I was in a group of three other developers building a full-stack application(eCommerce website). My day consists of daily checkups, individual or group meetings with the team and/or instructors, filing and responding to help tickets, respondings to chat logs and/or emails, Q&A sessions, etc… My team and I decided to take advantage of Slack automated tool ‘Workflow Builder’ to reduce the time we spent responding and working on our daily tasks. In Slack, I was able to create recurring progress updates for my team to know my current status on the project. Schedule recurring messages that will alert my team in advance also including reminders. Adding new tasks onto an existing project for my teammates to start. Using this tool help my teammates and me to focus primarily on our eCommerce website without worrying about the daily tasks needed to be done. 

## If you are a website owner who wants to understand how your visitors interact  with it, which key metrics would you capture and how would you analyze them? 

- A key metrics I would capture is the “bounce rate”. The bounce rate is defined as the percentage of visits that browses through one page before exiting a site. This could be by leaving the site through an external link, pressing the browser back button, typing a new URL in the web browser, and not interacting with a website leading to a session timeout. I would analyze this key metric by determining if any new updates and or existing functionality on the site is causing lowering site traffic. Testing out any functionality and even the website styling through a consumer’s perspective and how it may cause a consumer to exit out quickly. Finding any issues to improve and make it more appealing and flexible to gain site traffic.

## What is the IP address of the web server? Explain the result of your investigation. 
- The IP address of the webserver is 192.0.66.136. In order to locate the IP address, I had to do a thorough search on google how to find a website’s IP address. The website I stumbled upon was https://serverguy.com/. This website gave guidelines and three quick ways to locate an IP address. I chose to do the command line approach. Using the Windows command line, at the prompt I typed in ‘tracert’ followed a single space I typed in ‘snowplowanalytics.com’, excluding ‘www’. After I pressed enter and was able to locate the IP address.
